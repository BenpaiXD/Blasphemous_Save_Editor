# Blasphemous_Save_Editor
Save editor for the game Blasphemous by The Game Kitchen

### These are the instructions for the v1.0 of this tool and could change on future versions.
This is a pretty straight forward save editor. Here's the break down:
- Click on load and browse to your .save file. If you're on windows it should be located in your `AppData/Locallow/TheGameKitchen/Blasphemous/Savegame/[random series of numbers/`

- Once you have open your file it should convert and load everything inside the larger textbox. You can either edit the file directly from here or save it as a json file and edit it using [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/), [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), etc.

- If you choose to modify it using another text editor you can take that modified json file and load it just as you did with the .save file. It will load your json data in the textbox as it would with a .save file.

- When you're done modifying it click on save as .save, there should be a savegame_0(Modified).save on the same folder where you ran the .exe

- Backup your initial save (just to be safe) and drag your modified file onto your blasphemous savegame folder and rename it so that the game can recognize it.

- Run your game and you're done.
